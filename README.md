### Titanic Report
---
## Purpose

This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset to provide detailed insights into passenger survival rates and demographics. Through the use of interactive Power BI dashboards, the analysis delivers a structured view of critical metrics, patterns, and trends.


---

 ## Objectives

1. To conduct a detailed analysis of survival rates based on factors such as gender, passenger class (Pclass), and embarkation points.


2. To create interactive visualizations that enhance understanding and exploration of the dataset.


3. To identify the key determinants of survival and provide actionable insights.

### Report Structure


### Page 1: Overview

### Description:
This page provides a comprehensive summary of passenger demographics and survival details. It highlights key figures and trends at a high level.

### Key Points:

1. Total Passengers Analyzed: 857,000.


2. Number of Survivors: 342,000.


3. Number of Non-Survivors: 515,000.


4. Embarkation Distribution:

Southampton: Most passengers embarked here.

Cherbourg: Passengers from this point had the best survival rates.

Queenstown: Fewer passengers embarked here compared to other locations.




### Visual Elements:

1. Doughnut Chart: Displays the percentage distribution of passengers by embarkation points.


2. Bar Chart: Shows a comparative analysis of survivors versus non-survivors.



### Insights:

1. Most passengers boarded from Southampton, forming the majority.


2. Cherbourg embarkees had higher survival probabilities compared to others.

### Page 2: Percentage Distribution

### Description:
This page focuses on the distribution of passengers by gender and emphasizes survival patterns among males and females.

### Key Points:

1. Passenger Distribution by Gender:

Male Passengers: A larger proportion of the dataset.

Female Passengers: Smaller in number but with a higher survival rate.



2. Survival Breakdown by Gender:

Female passengers had a higher survival probability across all categories.




Visual Elements:

1. Pie Chart: Highlights the gender distribution of passengers.


2. Bar Chart: Compares male and female passenger counts.


3. Line Chart: Illustrates survival trends segmented by gender and embarkation point.



Insights:

1. Females had significantly better chances of survival compared to males.


2. Gender was a critical determinant of survival in this dataset.

### Page 3: Survived & Non-Survived

### Description:
This page explores the relationship between passenger survival rates, gender, and passenger class.

### Key Points:

1. Survival Based on Passenger Class:

First-Class Passengers: Highest survival rates.

Third-Class Passengers: Lowest survival rates.



2. Survival Distribution by Gender:

Females consistently outperformed males in survival probabilities, regardless of class.



3. Class Influence on Survival:

Wealthier passengers in higher classes had better survival odds.




Visual Elements:

1. Stacked Bar Chart: Displays survivors and non-survivors across all classes.


2. Clustered Column Chart: Compares survival between genders within each class.



Insights:

1. Passenger class played a major role in survival outcomes.


2. Females in first class had the highest likelihood of survival, while males in third class had the lowest.

### Page 4: Comparison

### Description:
This page delves into comparative insights, highlighting survival rates across multiple dimensions such as gender and passenger class.

### Key Points:

1. Class Survival Rates:

First Class: Highest survival chances due to better access to lifeboats.

Second Class: Intermediate survival chances.

Third Class: Limited survival opportunities.



2. Gender Influence Across Classes:

Female survival rates were higher across all classes.

Males in lower classes faced the greatest survival challenges.




Visual Elements:

1. Clustered Bar Chart: Shows survival rates broken down by class.


2. Stacked Bar Chart: Compares male and female survival within each class.



Insights:

1. Gender and class were interconnected factors influencing survival.

2. Wealth and access to resources in higher classes were key determinants.

### Page 5: Analysis

### Description:
This page provides a deeper look into the impact of age and gender on survival. It focuses on age distribution across survivors and non-survivors.

### Key Points:

1. Age Distribution:

Younger passengers showed higher survival probabilities.

Middle-aged and older passengers faced greater challenges in survival.



2. Gender and Age:

Females, regardless of age, had better survival chances compared to males.

Male survival decreased sharply in older age groups.




Visual Elements:

1. Histogram: Depicts the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.


2. Pie Chart: Highlights the distribution of passenger age by gender.



Insights:

1. Age was a decisive factor, with younger passengers having a better chance of survival.


2. Gender amplified the influence of age on survival outcomes.
