Purpose

This project delves into the Titanic dataset to analyze and extract insights about passengers' survival rates and demographics. The analysis is presented through interactive dashboards built using Power BI, providing a clear and comprehensive view of key metrics and trends in the data.

Objectives

1. Perform a detailed analysis of survival rates based on gender, passenger class (Pclass), and embarkation points.


2. Create interactive visualizations for better understanding and exploration of the dataset.


3. Highlight the critical factors influencing survival with concise insights.

Report Structure

Page 1: Overview

Description:
This page provides a high-level summary of key metrics, including survival counts, non-survival counts, and embarkation details.

Key Insights:

The majority of passengers embarked from Southampton.

Cherbourg passengers had noticeably better survival rates compared to those from other points of embarkation.


Visual Elements:

Doughnut Chart: Displays the proportion of passengers based on their embarkation points.

Bar Chart: Shows a comparison of total survivors and non-survivors.

Page 2: Percentage Distribution

Description:
This page focuses on the distribution of passengers by gender and highlights survival patterns.

Key Insights:

Males constituted the majority of passengers, but their survival rates were lower compared to females.

Gender played a significant role in survival probabilities.


Visual Elements:

Pie Chart: Represents the breakdown of passengers by gender.

Bar Chart: Compares the number of male and female passengers.

Line Chart: Tracks survival trends segmented by gender and embarkation point.

Page 3: Survived & Non-Survived

Description:
This page examines the comparison between the total number of survivors and non-survivors, broken down by gender and passenger class.

Key Insights:

Higher-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.

Females had better survival rates than males across all classes.

The third-class passengers faced the lowest chances of survival.


Visual Elements:

Stacked Bar Chart: Shows the comparison of survivors and non-survivors across passenger classes.

Clustered Column Chart: Highlights survival differences between males and females.

Page 4: Comparison

Description:
This page compares survival rates across different passenger classes and analyzes the influence of gender within each class.

Key Insights:

First-class passengers had the highest chances of survival.

Survival rates drastically dropped for third-class passengers.

Gender had a pronounced effect on survival probabilities within each class.


Visual Elements:

Clustered Bar Chart: Illustrates survival rates across all classes.

Stacked Bar Chart: Breaks down survival by gender within each class.

Page 5: Analysis

Description:
This page provides a detailed analysis of the age distribution and its interaction with gender in influencing survival.

Key Insights:

Younger passengers displayed varying survival probabilities depending on their gender and passenger class.

Age, coupled with class and gender, was a significant determinant of survival.


Visual Elements:

Histogram: Displays the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.

Pie Chart: Highlights the distribution of ages by gender.

Results

1. Key Findings:

Survival rates were influenced significantly by gender and passenger class.

Passengers from Cherbourg exhibited higher survival probabilities compared to those from other embarkation points.



2. Visualization Impact:

The Power BI dashboards effectively showcase the underlying patterns and trends in the dataset.
